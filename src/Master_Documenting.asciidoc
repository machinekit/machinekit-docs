GOAL: The Best Documented Project Ever
======================================

We aim to make this project the best documented project ever...

_Why?_
=====

Because that will help speed up the development of Machinekit...

If the documentation
of this project can help a *Person* get started, a *User* get better, an
*Integrator* working faster and help a *Developer* maintaining focus and
better reference then everybody can benefit from this wonderfull project.

_What?_
=======
Machinekit is a fast evolving project. The development of recent years have
resulted in smaller and faster processors, different OS'es and a lot of applications
that were not possible before. Think about the reprap project for example.

This fast evolving time asks for:

- Up-to-date instructions.
- Up-to-date examples.
- Up-to-date references.
- Up-to-date knowledge.

_How?_
=====
. read up on link:http://www.machinekit.io/docs/contributing/[contributing].
. get a Github user account.
. fork the machinekit-docs repo.
. add to the docs in your fork.
. make a pull request.
