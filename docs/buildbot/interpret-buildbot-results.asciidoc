Buildbot
========

The buildbot grid can be found link:http://buildbot.dovetail-automata.com/grid[buildbot.dovetail-automata.com/grid]
and this knowledge is very usefull if you make a PR because you can see if or why
a build fails.

As you are making a change or improvement you are the one who knows what your
change is about. So it should be relatively easy for you to fix your PR in case
of a failed build so that your PR can be built.

Here's an example of a PR which initially failed. It was a PR where a lot of
files were renamed from `.txt` to `.asciidoc`.

== Step 1

go to your PR and take note of the number (in this case it was
link:https://github.com/machinekit/machinekit/pull/400[#400]). This you need
to know if you want to see interpret the buildbot.

== Step 2

go to the link:http://buildbot.dovetail-automata.com/grid[buildbot grid]
where you can find the specific PR number. you can clearly see that it failed.

== Step 3

now click (like the blue link in the picture above) the link to the
failed build (#6). This will give you another link to the `stdio`, the output of
the build.

== Step 4

depending on your experience you search for specific errors. In this
case I use `ctrl`+`f` to search for `error` and I pick the last mention. But
you might need some different stuff.

== Step 5

correct your error (like renaming an line with `.txt` to `.asciidoc`
reference) and push your commit to the branch for which you made the PR.
This will ensure that the updated branch gets rebuilt by the buildbot. Enabling
you to see if the correction was sufficient.
