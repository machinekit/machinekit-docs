## Community channels

The Machinekit community gathers around the [Google group][1] and the
[GitHub issue tracker][2].


## Machinekit Google group

Users and developers discuss Machinekit in the [Machinekit Google
group][1].  The group can be accessed via the web or subscribed to as
an email list:

- View the group in a web-based forum-like format at
  [http://groups.google.com/group/machinekit][1]

- Subscribe in list format by sending an email to
  [machinekit+subscribe@googlegroups.com][4].  (Be sure to reply to
  Google's join request confirmation email.)

Both means are equivalent, and give access to the same postings.


## Machinekit GitHub issue tracker

Report problems with Machinekit on the [GitHub issue tracker][2].
When submitting an issue, please read the following instructions carefully:

[Submitting an error][5]

- Choose a meaningful title

- Provide a clear description of the problem

- Paste error messages or other output useful for debugging

When pasting output, which may contain special characters interpreted
as text formatting by [GitHub-flavored markdown][3], quote it using
three backtick characters as in the following example:

    ```
    MODPOST 1 modules
    WARNING: "rtapi_print_msg" [/tmp/tmpbbJkRv/test_define.ko] undefined!
    ```

Before submitting, check the `Preview` tab above the edit window to
make sure the output formatting is sane.
