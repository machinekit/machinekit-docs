== Index of Instantiated HAL Components


The essential difference between normal realtime components and instantiable components,

is that 'normal components' are loaded once only and have to create as many copies of the

component as they need, all at once, there and then.


Instantiable components load the 'base component' and from that can create instances.

of the component whenever they are required.

So instances can be created in separate hal files, on-the-fly or whatever.

Amoungst many advantages, it opens up huge flexibility in configuration.
