install can-utils and wireshark by opening a terminal.
[source,shell]
----
me@VM:~$ sudo apt-get install can-utils wireshark
----

Next action will be to start the can interface when starting up.
[source,shell]
----
me@VM:~$ sudo gedit /etc/modules
----

and add `vcan` to this file
then save and exit.

then add the following to the next file
[source,shell]
----
me@VM:~$ sudo gedit /etc/rc.local
----

and add
```
ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan
ip link set up vcan0
```

Make sure that Wireshark can sniff packets without running as a root. This
information tells us all what we need to know.
[source,shell]
----
me@VM:~$ less /usr/share/doc/wireshark-common/README.Debian
----

so when we have read this we do:
[source,shell]
----
me@VM:~$ dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common
me@VM:~$ sudo usermod -a -G wireshark me
----

You should have typed {yes} when doing the reconfigure and substituted
"me" with your {own username}.

Reboot your machine, log in, and start wireshark.
you should see the following screen. Notice "vcan0"

start capturing the vcan0 interface by selecting the `vcan0` interface and
clicking `start`.

Open a terminal and give the following command:
[source,shell]
----
me@VM:~$ cansend vcan0 001#04.01.00.00.0f.ff.e7.00
