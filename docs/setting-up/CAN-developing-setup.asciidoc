Make sure that Wireshark can sniff packets without running as a root. This
information tells us all what we need to know.
[source,shell]
----
me@VM:~$ less /usr/share/doc/wireshark-common/README.Debian
----

so when we have read this we do:
[source,shell]
----
me@VM:~$ dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common
me@VM:~$ sudo usermod -a -G wireshark me
----

You should have typed {yes} when doing the reconfigure and substituted
"me" with your {own username}.

Reboot your machine, log in, and start wireshark.
you should see the following screen. Notice "vcan0"

Open a terminal and give the following command:
