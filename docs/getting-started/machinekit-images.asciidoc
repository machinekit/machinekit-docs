=== BeagleBone Debian Machinekit image

Robert C. Nelson kindly provides a 2-weekly build of a complete Debian with
Machinekit image for a BeagleBone Black/White.

Head over to link:http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBoneBlack_Debian#BBW.2FBBB_.28All_Revs.29_Machinekit[elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBoneBlack_Debian#BBW.2FBBB_.28All_Revs.29_Machinekit]
and download and install the image on a microSD card and run the image from
that, or install the image on the eMMC.

Instructions on writing a microSD card link:https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=beaglebone+black+flashing+SD+card[can be found here] by doing a Google search. There are plenty examples and tutorials
around also for writing the image to the eMMC.
