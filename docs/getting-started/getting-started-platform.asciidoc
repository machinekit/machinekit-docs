= Setting up machinekit on a platform

This document is intended to get Machinekit installed on the platform of your
choice. Because of the multi-platform nature of the machinekit project there
can be some differences in the installation for a specific platform.

[NOTE]
You should first have a working Debian installation.

== Installation options:

=== Images

=== Installing packages

link:../installing-packages[Installing Packages]


=== Development packages

In addition to the configuring of the APT repository, installation of the
kernel, there are some additional steps to take to install a development
setup.
