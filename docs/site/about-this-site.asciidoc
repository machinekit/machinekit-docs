= How to use this website

== Search

This is a custom Google search engine covering the www.machinekit.io website and the http://blog.machinekit.io/[blog].

== Editing pages

The site source is hosted on link:https://github.com/machinekit/machinekit-docs[github] - if you want to edit content,
you first need a github account. Changing the website works like any other change to machinekit - using the normal http://www.machinekit.io/community/c4/[C4 process]: you create a Pull Request, which is merged by
one of the maintainers, after which the changes are incorporated into the source of machinekit, or - in this case - the website.

You will find that allmost all pages have an link:https://github.com/machinekit/machinekit-docs//edit/master/docs/site/about-this-site.asciidoc[Edit this page] link in the right column. Clicking link leads you directly into edit mode on github - after you have made your changes, describe what they are about in the 'Commit changes' box at the bottom, 'Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request', then click
'Propose file change'

== Previewing changes

Opening a Pull Request triggers an update of the link:http://preview.machinekit.io[preview.machinekit.io Pull Request Preview site] and your change should be online within minutes. This process is capable of only showing the latest PR - but the status of the preview formatting run is recorded in the PR status.

== Going live: merge by maintainers

As soon as a maintainer gets around to merge your PR, the result is rendered
on http://www.machinekit.io[www.machinekit.io] . This step takes
slightly longer - but typically less than two minutes - as
it runs a http://www.machinekit.io/linkchecker.html[linkchecker]
step to analyze the site for broken links.


== Contributing a new page: use the link:http://www.machinekit.io/docs/sandbox/index.html[sandbox] to get started!

Mick came up with this neat idea - just follow the instructions there and commit as PR!
See the Sandbox link on the right above the Search box.

== Contributing a large chunk of material: editing and previewing locally

The 'Edit this page' process is great for small changes. For big chunks of material - not so much. In this case it is best to set up jekyll-asciidoctor locally. The edit-preview turnaround is very quick - Instructions will follow here hortly !


== Discussing improvements: use the link:https://github.com/machinekit/machinekit-docs/issues[docs tracker]

Please go straight to these anchor issues depending on topic:

- link:https://github.com/machinekit/machinekit-docs/issues/117[overall site structure, content categories, navigation]
- link:https://github.com/machinekit/machinekit-docs/issues/118[style/formatting/css etc issues]
- link:https://github.com/machinekit/machinekit-docs/issues/103[Documentation and manual organisation]
- link:https://github.com/machinekit/machinekit-docs/issues/119[Documentation/manpage errors/unclear]

== How this site is built

The docs repo is formatted by link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc[jekyll-asciidoctor]; the resulting
HTML is automatically pushed to link:https://github.com/machinekit/machinekit.github.io[Github to serve static content].

The jekyll installation is packaged into a link:https://github.com/mhaberler/docker-jekyll-asciidoctor[docker container]
which contains a series of tools for embedded diagrams and source highlighting, for instance link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-diagram[asciidoctor-diagram] and link:http://pygments.org/[pygments].

Some examples:

- http://www.machinekit.io/docs/documenting/diagram-examples/[embedding various diagrams and highlighting source code fragments]
- http://www.machinekit.io/docs/documenting/plugins/[embedding Asciinema, Youtube videos, and gists]
