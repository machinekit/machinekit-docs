Welcome to the Machinekit Documentation
//__=======================================

Here you'll find the paths to information regarding building, working and
collaborating on the Machinekit project and the Machinekit-docs.

Getting Help
//__==============

If you're:
- stuck
- run into a problem
- get errors
- or similar
you should ask a question on the google group Machinekit list.
But before you ask a question, please do read the following link:../getting-help[getting help instruction].

Place to start
//__==============

The first place you'll want to start is link:../index[documents index]
This location bundles copies with updated links of the legacy `Master_*.asciidoc`
files in link:../src[] that were being used to generate LinuxCNC `.pdf` pages and
`.html` files. These are currently no longer built and making these will require
work.

Making documentation should be easy
//__===================================

One of the tasks for the splitting of the `docs` in a separate repo was that it
should be easy for anybody to document something. Because of that we focus on
`.asciidoc` files that can be read and improved upon. This is 2015 after all :)
You can actually help improve this documentation without knowing anything of
"git". Just read these link:..//documenting/documenting[instructions] and
you'll be ready to go in the blink of an eye.

Also have a look at link:../documentation-matrix[this matrix]
to see if the information you search is there. Or if there is something in
particular worth improving.

Machinekit manpages
//__===================

Soon there will be a new machinekit-man repo with generated `.asciidoc` files
where we can link to from this repo. That way an up-to-date and homo-sapiens
readable variant of the component documentation will be readily available.

If you want to make or change `manpage` documentation, you should be at
link:https://github.com/machinekit/machinekit/tree/master/man[the machinekit/man directory]
when you build machinekit and want to see which manpages are generated and which are manually created you should look at the extension.
Previously *all* components in link:https://github.com/machinekit/machinekit/tree/master/man/man9[machinekit/man/man9]
for example had the `.9` extension. The generated component manpages will be
recognisable at the `.9comp` extension.

Changing a generated component manpage should be done in the component source.
