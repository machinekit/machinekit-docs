Documenting
===========

The quick-start guide for the impatiant.

Remember: no change is too small!

Helping out can be done in various ways. You should choose the one that best fits you.
No matter what you do, to get your changes into the master branch you need to
work via these link:http://www.machinekit.io/docs/contributing/[instructions.]

The original documents that originated in LinuxCNC were split in a separate repo
so that we have a way of getting the documentation more accessible via the web
and make it as easy as possible for people who are `fresh' to start getting up
to speed with the workflow of contributing.

These instructions are for `basic' use.
Assuming that you're fresh below are some instructions on setting up stuff so
you can start to do what you want to do. And share your changes.

== Getting it

- The easiest way to start after reading the link:http://www.machinekit.io/docs/contributing/[instructions]
above is to link:https://github.com/join[get a Github user account].
- log into your new account and fork the `machinekit-docs` repo.

== Do what you intend to do

- If this is the first time with a freshly forked repo, go to the next point. If
the original has changed then you probably need to have your fork updated. Read the
link:updating-your-fork.asciidoc[updating your fork] instructions.

- click on the file you want to change and edit the contents.

- when you're done scroll down.
  * give a good commit message, like `<the file you changed>: <what you did>`
  * optionally more info.
  * push the `commit` button

- this will make the commit in your forked repo.

== Share!

Next thing is to get your changes in the master branch of `machinkit-docs` (or
maybe in `machinekit` or some other original repo you forked from). This is done
by creating a ``Pull Request'' or `PR` for short.

- notice the green button to compare for a pull request below?

- Pushing this button will get you to the next screen where you can create your comments
for the `PR`. Also remember to describe this in the way you did when you created
your commit. this will help a maintainer understand what you did, and why. So then
the review will be much easier to understand.

- when you finished this the maintainers of the project will get a message and can
review your change.
