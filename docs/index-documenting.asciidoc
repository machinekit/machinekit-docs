GOAL: The Best Documented Project Ever
======================================

We aim to make this project the best documented project ever...

At this point in time the documentation is a big work in progress and will probably
change a good deal in layout and structure. Improving as we go.
So please update your copy frequently.

_Why documentation?_
====================

Because that will help speed up the development of Machinekit...

If the documentation of this project can help a *Person* get started, a *User* get better, an
*Integrator* working faster and help a *Developer* maintaining focus and
better reference then everybody can benefit from this wonderfull project.

_What is Machinekit?_
=====================
Machinekit is a fast evolving project. The development of recent years have
resulted in smaller and faster processors, different OS'es and a lot of applications
that were not possible before. Think about the reprap project for example.

This fast evolving time asks for:

- Up-to-date instructions.
- Up-to-date examples.
- Up-to-date references.
- Up-to-date knowledge.

_How can i help documenting?_
